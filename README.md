Simple beginner Static App using Gatsby

Installing and using Gatsby
Gatsby is available via the gatsby-cli JavaScript package. You have two ways you can use it:

Global install, run npm install gatsby-cli -g, this will install the executable gatsby on your machine. You can now use Gatsby like so in your terminal: gatsby <command>.
Use npx, npx is a tool that makes it possible to run executable files without first installing them on your machine. If you use this way of installing you need to prefix your calls to Gatsby like so npx gatsby <command>.
